# Xulrunner Websecurify

This is the original source code for Websecurify Desktop Web Application Security Scanner. The scanner was released in in 2008 and quickly became pretty successful also targeting multiple platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS. The Websecurify Desktop Web Security Scanner was also released in macOS AppStore making it the first (and last at the time of writing) web application security testing tool on the store.

## Structure

The code is largely undocumented and copied verbatim from the original SVN code tree. This is a Xulrunner application so it is heavily structured and follows the Firefox extension development model which is not absolute.

## Purpose

This code is now absolute and unmaintained. Websecurify will be making additional work in this space with our next generation web application security scanner. Sec [secapps.com](https://secapps.com) for more information.
