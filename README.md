# Xulrunner Websecurify

This is the original source code for Websecurify Desktop Web Application Security Scanner. The scanner was released in in 2008 and quickly become successful targeting multiple: Windows, Linux and MacOSx. It was also released in macOS AppStore making it the first web application security testing tool on the store.

## Structure

The code is largely undocumented and copied verbatim from the original SVN code tree. This is a Xulrunner application so it is heavily structured and follows the Firefox extension model.

## Purpose

This code is now absolute and unmaintained. Websecurify will be making additional work in this space with our next generation web application security scanner.
